        <h2>"I just like to have too many hobbies"</h2>
        <p>Anyone else feel like they have too many hobbies and not enough time?
            While some of us have escaped the 9-5 job spiral, I am still stuck (well, 7:30-4 technically, but you get the point). This doesn't allow much time for my various hobbies which include: video games, movies, tennis, weightlifting, manga, anime, rock climbing, among other things.
            
            I enjoy all of these activities and want to give each one of them equal amount of time, but it just doesn't seem like there are enough hours in the day.
            
            My daily routine (currently) is: wake up at 6 a.m. then get ready for work, 50 minute commute to office, get in at 7:30 then stay until 4, head to gym straight from work, get home around 6:30. I then eat dinner with the girlfriend and by the time this is all over, I only have a couple of hours before I go to bed, normally around 9:30 - 10.
            
            Has anyone else experienced this? Is it just a matter of rearranging your day and sticking with a routine that benefits you the most? Or did you just put some hobbies on the chopping block?
            
            I would love to hear some thoughts, thanks!</p>
